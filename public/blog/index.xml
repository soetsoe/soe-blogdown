      <description>Overview The data used in this visualization is a subset of the Gapminder Dataset on world facts that can be used to examine social, political, and economic indicators. In this exercise we plot the life expectancy distribution for each continent.
The R code below creates a table and plot of life expectancy distribution. We used the aggregate function to subsample the dataset and generate summary statistics. The summary statistics were then combined to create a single table tabulating the statisitics by continent.</description>

      <description>Overview The dataset &amp;lsquo;Animal Sounds Summary&amp;rsquo; contains the results of a study that examined how well children in different age groups can understand or reproduce an animal sound. Three animal sounds were used in the study: &amp;ldquo;cockadoodledoo&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;meow&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;woof woof&amp;rdquo;. More than 2000 children between the ages 8 through 18 participated in the study that documented the proportion of the children (by age group) that can either understand or reproduce each of the animal sounds.</description>

      <description>Overview The data used in this visualization is a subset of the Africa Developer Indicator dataset collected by the World Bank, compiled from officially recognized international sources. With this dataset, we examined the trends in public spending on education and GDP per capita for African nations between the years 1970 and 2012. Before importing the data into R, the original dataset was filtered to only include entries that contain records of both public spending on education and GDP per capita for a given country and year.</description>
