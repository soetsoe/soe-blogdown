I am part of a research and development team at Intel Corporation specializing in machine learning and computer vision.  As a platform architect, I help define and build next generation hardware-software solutions to improve user experience and utility of personal computing devices.   

I received a BS in Electrical Engineering from Oregon State University, and expect to receive a MS in Computer Science & Engineering from Oregon Health Science University in 2019.  

I enjoy reading, outdoor activities, and discovering the world with our ever so curious 3 year old son.
