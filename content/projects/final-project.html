<p>The International Financial Inclusion Funding Dataset contains records of major international funding for microfinance and financial inclusion projects. The data was collected through surveys conducted by the <a href="http://www.cgap.org/about">Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP)</a>.</p>
<p>In this data visualization exercise, we plot the trends in funding across geographies between the years 2011 to 2016. The graphs and commentaries are embedded in the Xaringan slide below.</p>
