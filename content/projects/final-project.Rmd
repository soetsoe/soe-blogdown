The International Financial Inclusion Funding Dataset contains records of  major international funding for microfinance and financial inclusion projects.  The data was collected through surveys conducted by the [Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP)](http://www.cgap.org/about).  

In this data visualization exercise, we plot the trends in funding across geographies between the years 2011 to 2016.  The graphs and commentaries are embedded in the Xaringan slide below.
